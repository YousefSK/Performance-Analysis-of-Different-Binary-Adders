# Introduction
In this lab, we constructed the design of three types of 16-bit adders: the ripple carry adder, the lookahead adder, and the carry select adder. This lab acts as a transition introduction to using SystemVerilog on Xilinx Vivado to implement on the FPGA board. It required some basic understanding of SystemVerilog's syntax and Vivado's analysis tools. The ripple adder is the simplest one of the three; it consists of N full adders, which is the 1-bit version of the binary adder. Each carryout from the full adder goes as a carry-in into the next full adder. The carry lookahead adder uses the carry-in with the inputs of every bit to make predictions about the carry-out. A carry-out is generated when both inputs are 1, or a carry-out could be propagated if either input is 1. The carry select adder uses two full adders and a multiplexer for each bit. One adder computes the carry-out assuming that the carry-in is one, and the other assumes itâ€™s zero. Then, the real carry-in selects the output of the desired full adders in all bits simultaneously. We will discuss each adder in this report regarding area, power, and maximum operating frequencies.
